title: Santatizer @ The Selfless Selfish

[The Selfless Selfish](https://www.facebook.com/theSelflessSelfish/) is a yearly charitable party taking place near Christmas. In 2014, I got the chance to do an installation for the event @The ARK Bucharest.

The project used face tracking on a webcam feed to overlay a santa beard and hat over viewers.
