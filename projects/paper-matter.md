title: Paper JS & Matter JS integration
---

Old project demonstrating how you could use a 2D drawing library ([PaperJS](http://paperjs.org/)) together with a 2D physics library ([MatterJS](https://brm.io/matter-js/)) in Javascript. It was fun, and you can check the repo [here](https://github.com/andreiantonescu/paper-matter).
