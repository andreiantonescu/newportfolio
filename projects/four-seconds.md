An iOS game around a very simple, but entertaining concept: <b>can you stop a timer at exactly four seconds</b>?

I described the process of building this fun little project in the following article [on Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/four-seconds-the-story-of-how-i-released-my-first-game-c0570ccf0b5e).

Be sure to check the game's website at [fourseconds.superblob.studio](https://fourseconds.superblob.studio/) and download it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/four-seconds/id1280965840?ls=1) to play (it's free - no ads).

Some fun trivia:
* Four Seconds got over 100 votes when launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/four-seconds#four-seconds)
* from this thread on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17940407) I learned that people used to play these types of games on Casio watches back in the day

Let me know how far you can get on the all time leaderboard!
