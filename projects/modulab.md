title: Symbiomorphogenesis - Face Drawing
---

In 2013, as part of the local makerspace Modulab, I participated in the first exhibition of interactive installations in Romania - Symbiomorphogenesis. 

The project explored various forms of symbiosis between man and technology and was held at the National [Museum of Contemporary Art in Bucharest](https://www.mnac.ro/).

My project was a face tracking system that used two printer axes to move a light source behind a screen, which was embedded with a phosphorescent dust. 

This allowed people to "draw" on this surface by moving their head in front of the camera. Huge thanks to Paul and the team at Modulab for helping out with the hardware part of this setup.

Unfortunately, the resources remaining online are scarce, and I did not do a proper archiving job at the time. For this project, we're left with the image above, unless I find additional materials on some old phone - friendly reminder to dilligently archive your projects ðŸ’¾.
