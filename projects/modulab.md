title: Symbiomorphogenesis Face Drawing
---

I participated in the first exhibition of interactive installations in Romania, Symbiomorphogenesis, as part of the local makerspace Modulab in 2013. 

The project explored various forms of symbiosis between man and technology and was held at the National [Museum of Contemporary Art in Bucharest](https://www.mnac.ro/).
