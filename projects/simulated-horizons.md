title: Simulated Horizons - generative art & AI project
---

Dreams of inexistent landscapes are brought to life via AI-generated prompts, which are then fed into image-generation systems.

These are then pixel sorted, reinforcing their traits, but stripping out the irregularities and glitches of AI-generated images, forming a simulated utopia of sceneries.

The human comes into play by taking a subjective review and curation of the outputs while asking the AI to reinterpret the initial prompt that started the whole sequence as a symbolic haiku.

This project stemmed from my passion of pixel sorting combined with the latest AI and image generation developments. Some samples can be viewed below, the rest can be minted on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/collection/simulated-horizons).
