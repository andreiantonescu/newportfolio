Andrei is a Bucharest-based artist who likes to blend the technical and the creative. A natural hyphenate, he likes to explore generative systems and the intersection of seemingly unrelated data fields, such as pixels in an image and sound notes. Some notable achievements include the launch of "Pixel Music" in 2023, an application that transforms images into melodic sequences, and his 2021 "Tangled" project on Art Blocks, which draws 32-byte transaction hashes into 2D space . Andrei's work has been exhibited at the National Museum of Contemporary Art of Romania, as part of an exhibition organized by the local maker space Modulab.
